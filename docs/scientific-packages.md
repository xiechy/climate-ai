- **Data Commons** - Programmatic access to public statistical data from global sources including census bureaus, health organizations, and environmental agencies. Provides unified Python API for querying demographic data, economic indicators, health statistics, and environmental datasets through a knowledge graph interface. Features three main endpoints: Observation (statistical time-series queries for population, GDP, unemployment rates, disease prevalence), Node (knowledge graph exploration for entity relationships and hierarchies), and Resolve (entity identification from names, coordinates, or Wikidata IDs). Seamless Pandas integration for DataFrames, relation expressions for hierarchical queries, data source filtering for consistency, and support for custom Data Commons instances
- **Matplotlib** - Publication-quality plotting and visualization
- **Polars** - High-performance DataFrame operations with lazy evaluation
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization with dataset-oriented interface, automatic confidence intervals, publication-quality themes, colorblind-safe palettes, and comprehensive support for exploratory analysis, distribution comparisons, correlation matrices, regression plots, and multi-panel figures
- **SimPy** - Process-based discrete-event simulation framework for modeling systems with processes, queues, and resource contention (manufacturing, service operations, network traffic, logistics). Supports generator-based process definition, multiple resource types (Resource, PriorityResource, PreemptiveResource, Container, Store), event-driven scheduling, process interaction mechanisms (signaling, interruption, parallel/sequential execution), real-time simulation synchronized with wall-clock time, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities for utilization, wait times, and queue statistics
- **ReportLab** - Programmatic PDF generation for reports and documents

## Genomics Tools
- **Zarr** - Chunked, compressed N-dimensional array storage


## Scientific Communication & Publishing
- **Paper-2-Web** - Autonomous pipeline for transforming academic papers into multiple promotional formats using the Paper2All system. Converts LaTeX or PDF papers into: (1) Paper2Web - interactive, layout-aware academic homepages with responsive design, interactive figures, and mobile support; (2) Paper2Video - professional presentation videos with slides, narration, cursor movements, and optional talking-head generation using Hallo2; (3) Paper2Poster - print-ready conference posters with custom dimensions, professional layouts, and institution branding. Supports GPT-4/GPT-4.1 models, batch processing, QR code generation, multi-language content, and quality assessment metrics. Use cases: conference materials, video abstracts, preprint enhancement, research promotion, poster sessions, and academic website creation

## Document Processing & Conversion
- **MarkItDown** - Python utility for converting 20+ file formats to Markdown optimized for LLM processing. Converts Office documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX), images with OCR, audio with transcription, web content (HTML, YouTube transcripts, EPUB), and structured data (CSV, JSON, XML) while preserving document structure (headings, lists, tables, hyperlinks). Key features include: Azure Document Intelligence integration for enhanced PDF table extraction, LLM-powered image descriptions using GPT-4o, batch processing with ZIP archive support, modular installation for specific formats, streaming approach without temporary files, and plugin system for custom converters. Supports Python 3.10+. Use cases: preparing documents for RAG systems, extracting text from PDFs and Office files, transcribing audio to text, performing OCR on images and scanned documents, converting YouTube videos to searchable text, processing HTML and EPUB books, converting structured data to readable format, document analysis pipelines, and LLM training data preparation
