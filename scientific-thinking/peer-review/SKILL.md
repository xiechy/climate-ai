# Scientific Critical Evaluation and Peer Review

## Overview

Peer review is a systematic process for evaluating scientific manuscripts. Assess methodology, statistics, design, reproducibility, ethics, and reporting standards. Apply this skill for manuscript and grant review across disciplines with constructive, rigorous evaluation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Conducting peer review of scientific manuscripts for journals
- Evaluating grant proposals and research applications
- Assessing methodology and experimental design rigor
- Reviewing statistical analyses and reporting standards
- Evaluating reproducibility and data availability
- Checking compliance with reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA)
- Providing constructive feedback on scientific writing

## Peer Review Workflow

Conduct peer review systematically through the following stages, adapting depth and focus based on the manuscript type and discipline.

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment

Begin with a high-level evaluation to determine the manuscript's scope, novelty, and overall quality.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the central research question or hypothesis?
- What are the main findings and conclusions?
- Is the work scientifically sound and significant?
- Is the work appropriate for the intended venue?
- Are there any immediate major flaws that would preclude publication?

**Output:** Brief summary (2-3 sentences) capturing the manuscript's essence and initial impression.

### Stage 2: Detailed Section-by-Section Review

Conduct a thorough evaluation of each manuscript section, documenting specific concerns and strengths.

#### Abstract and Title
- **Accuracy:** Does the abstract accurately reflect the study's content and conclusions?
- **Clarity:** Is the title specific, accurate, and informative?
- **Completeness:** Are key findings and methods summarized appropriately?
- **Accessibility:** Is the abstract comprehensible to a broad scientific audience?

#### Introduction
- **Context:** Is the background information adequate and current?
- **Rationale:** Is the research question clearly motivated and justified?
- **Novelty:** Is the work's originality and significance clearly articulated?
- **Literature:** Are relevant prior studies appropriately cited?
- **Objectives:** Are research aims/hypotheses clearly stated?

#### Methods
- **Reproducibility:** Can another researcher replicate the study from the description provided?
- **Rigor:** Are the methods appropriate for addressing the research questions?
- **Detail:** Are protocols, reagents, equipment, and parameters sufficiently described?
- **Ethics:** Are ethical approvals, consent, and data handling properly documented?
- **Statistics:** Are statistical methods appropriate, clearly described, and justified?

**For each major comment:**
1. Clearly state the issue
2. Explain why it's problematic
3. Suggest specific solutions or additional experiments
4. Indicate if addressing it is essential for publication

### Minor Comments

List less critical issues that would improve clarity, completeness, or presentation. Number these sequentially.

**Minor comments typically include:**
- Unclear figure labels or legends
- Missing methodological details
- Typographical or grammatical errors
- Suggestions for improved data presentation
- Minor statistical reporting issues
- Supplementary analyses that would strengthen conclusions
- Requests for clarification

**For each minor comment:**
1. Identify the specific location (section, paragraph, figure)
2. State the issue clearly
3. Suggest how to address it

### Specific Line-by-Line Comments (Optional)

For manuscripts requiring detailed feedback, provide section-specific or line-by-line comments:
- Reference specific page/line numbers or sections
- Note factual errors, unclear statements, or missing citations
- Suggest specific edits for clarity

### Questions for Authors

List specific questions that need clarification:
- Methodological details that are unclear
- Seemingly contradictory results
- Missing information needed to evaluate the work
- Requests for additional data or analyses

## Tone and Approach

Maintain a constructive, professional, and collegial tone throughout the review.

**Best Practices:**
- **Be constructive:** Frame criticism as opportunities for improvement
- **Be specific:** Provide concrete examples and actionable suggestions
- **Be balanced:** Acknowledge strengths as well as weaknesses
- **Be respectful:** Remember that authors have invested significant effort
- **Be objective:** Focus on the science, not the scientists
- **Be thorough:** Don't overlook issues, but prioritize appropriately
- **Be clear:** Avoid ambiguous or vague criticism

**Avoid:**
- Personal attacks or dismissive language
- Sarcasm or condescension
- Vague criticism without specific examples
- Requesting unnecessary experiments beyond the scope
- Demanding adherence to personal preferences vs. best practices
- Revealing your identity if reviewing is double-blind

## Special Considerations by Manuscript Type

### Original Research Articles
- Emphasize rigor, reproducibility, and novelty
- Assess significance and impact
- Verify that conclusions are data-driven
- Check for complete methods and appropriate controls

### Reviews and Meta-Analyses
- Evaluate comprehensiveness of literature coverage
- Assess search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Verify systematic approach and lack of bias
- Check for critical analysis vs. mere summarization
- For meta-analyses, evaluate statistical approach and heterogeneity

### Methods Papers
- Emphasize validation and comparison to existing methods
- Assess reproducibility and availability of protocols/code
- Evaluate improvements over existing approaches
- Check for sufficient detail for implementation

### Short Reports/Letters
- Adapt expectations for brevity
- Ensure core findings are still rigorous and significant
- Verify that format is appropriate for findings

### Preprints
- Recognize that these have not undergone formal peer review
- May be less polished than journal submissions
- Still apply rigorous standards for scientific validity
- Consider providing constructive feedback to help authors improve before journal submission
