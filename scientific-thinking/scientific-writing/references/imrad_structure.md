# IMRAD Structure Guide

## Overview

IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion) is the predominant organizational structure for scientific journal articles of original research. Adopted as the majority format since the 1970s, it is now the standard in medical, health, biological, chemical, engineering, and computer sciences.

## Why IMRAD?

The IMRAD structure mirrors the scientific method:
- **Introduction**: What question did you ask?
- **Methods**: How did you study it?
- **Results**: What did you find?
- **Discussion**: What does it mean?

This logical flow makes scientific papers easier to write, read, and evaluate.

## Complete Manuscript Components

A full scientific manuscript typically includes these sections in order:

1. **Title**
2. **Abstract**
3. **Introduction**
4. **Methods** (also called Materials and Methods, Methodology)
5. **Results**
6. **Discussion** (sometimes combined with Results)
7. **Conclusion** (sometimes part of Discussion)
8. **Acknowledgments**
9. **References**
10. **Supplementary Materials** (if applicable)

## Title

### Purpose
Attract readers and accurately represent the paper's content.

### Guidelines
- Be concise yet descriptive (typically 10-15 words)
- Include key variables and the relationship studied
- Avoid abbreviations, jargon, and question formats (unless the journal allows)
- Make it specific enough to distinguish from other studies
- Include key search terms for discoverability

### Examples
- Good: "Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training on Cardiovascular Function in Older Adults"
- Too vague: "Exercise and Health"
- Too detailed: "A Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training Compared to Moderate Continuous Training on Cardiovascular Function Measured by VO2 Max in Adults Aged 60-75 Years"

## Abstract

### Purpose
Provide a complete, standalone summary enabling readers to decide if the full paper is relevant to them.

### Structure
Most journals now require **structured abstracts** with labeled sections:

**Background/Objective**: Why was the study needed? What was the aim?
- 1-2 sentences
- State the research problem and objective

**Methods**: How was it done?
- 2-4 sentences
- Study design, participants, key procedures, analysis methods

**Results**: What was found?
- 3-5 sentences
- Main findings with key statistics
- Present the most important numerical data

**Conclusions**: What does it mean?
- 1-2 sentences
- Interpretation and implications
- Avoid overstating or adding new information

### Length
- Typically 100-250 words (check journal requirements)
- Some journals allow up to 300 words

### Key Rules
- Write the abstract **last** (after completing all other sections)
- Make it fully understandable without reading the paper
- Do not cite references in the abstract
- Avoid abbreviations or define them at first use
- Use past tense for methods and results, present tense for conclusions
- Include key quantitative results with statistical measures

### Example Structure
```
Background: Hospital-acquired infections remain a major cause of morbidity. This study
evaluated the effectiveness of a new disinfection protocol in reducing infection rates.

Methods: We conducted a 12-month before-after study in a 500-bed teaching hospital.
Environmental surfaces were cultured monthly, and infection rates were tracked via
surveillance data. The intervention involved UV-C disinfection added to standard cleaning.

Results: Post-intervention, surface contamination decreased by 47% (95% CI: 38-56%,
p<0.001), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections declined from 3.2 to 1.8
per 1000 catheter-days (RR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.83, p=0.004). No adverse effects were
observed.

Conclusions: UV-C disinfection significantly reduced environmental contamination and
infection rates. This intervention may be a valuable addition to hospital infection
control programs.

### Key Principle
Show, don't interpret. Save interpretation for the Discussion.

### Structure and Content

**Opening Paragraph**
- Describe the participants/sample characteristics
- Report recruitment flow (e.g., screened, enrolled, completed)
- Consider including a CONSORT-style flow diagram

**Subsequent Paragraphs**
- Present results in logical order (usually primary outcome first)
- Follow the order of objectives stated in Introduction
- Organize by theme or by chronology, depending on what's clearest
- Reference figures and tables by number

**Each Finding Should Include:**
- The observed result
- The direction of the effect
- The magnitude of the effect
- The statistical significance
- The confidence interval

**Example**: "Mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 12 mmHg in the intervention group compared to 3 mmHg in controls (difference: 9 mmHg, 95% CI: 4-14 mmHg, p=0.002)."

### Integration with Figures and Tables

**When to Use:**
- **Figures**: Trends, patterns, distributions, comparisons, relationships
- **Tables**: Precise values, demographic data, multiple variables

**How to Reference:**
- "Figure 1 shows the distribution of..." (not "Figure 1 below")
- "Table 2 presents baseline characteristics..."
- Don't repeat all table data in text; highlight key findings
- Each figure/table should be referenced in text

### Figures and Tables Guidelines
- Number consecutively in order of mention
- Include complete, standalone captions
- Define all abbreviations in caption or footnote
- Report sample sizes (n)
- Indicate statistical significance (*, p-values)
- Use consistent formatting

### Statistical Reporting

- Degrees of freedom
- p-value (exact if p > 0.001, otherwise report as "p < 0.001")
- Effect size and confidence interval
- Sample sizes

**Example**: "Groups differed significantly on test performance (t(48) = 3.21, p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.34-1.40)."

### Length
- Typically 2-4 pages
- Roughly equivalent to Methods length

### Verb Tense
- **Past tense** for your findings ("The mean was...", "Participants showed...")

### Common Mistakes
- Interpreting results (save for Discussion)
- Repeating all table/figure data in text
- Presenting new methods
- Insufficient statistical detail
- Inconsistent units or notation
- Not addressing negative or unexpected findings
- Selective reporting (all tested hypotheses should be reported)

### Organization Strategies

**By Objective:**
```
Effect of intervention on primary outcome
Effect of intervention on secondary outcome A
Effect of intervention on secondary outcome B
```

**By Analysis Type:**
```
Descriptive statistics
Univariate analyses
Multivariate analyses
```

**Chronological:**
```
Baseline characteristics
Short-term outcomes (1 month)
Long-term outcomes (6 months)
```

## Discussion

### Purpose
Interpret findings, relate them to existing knowledge, acknowledge limitations, and propose future directions.

### Structure and Content

**Paragraph 1: Summary of Main Findings**
- Restate the primary objective or hypothesis
- Summarize the principal findings in 2-4 sentences
- Avoid repeating details from Results
- State clearly whether the hypothesis was supported

**Paragraphs 2-4: Interpretation in Context**
- Compare your findings with previous research
- Explain agreements and disagreements with prior work
- Propose mechanisms or explanations for findings
- Discuss unexpected results
- Consider alternative explanations
- Address whether findings support or refute existing theories

**Paragraph 5: Strengths and Limitations**
- Acknowledge study limitations honestly
- Explain how limitations might affect interpretation
- Mention study strengths (design, sample, methods)
- Avoid generic limitations ("larger sample needed")—be specific

**Paragraph 6: Implications**
- Clinical implications (for medical research)
- Practical applications
- Policy implications
- Theoretical contributions

**Final Paragraph: Conclusions and Future Directions**
- Summarize the take-home message
- Suggest specific future research to address gaps or limitations
- End with a strong concluding statement

### Length
- Typically 3-5 pages
- Usually the longest section

### Verb Tense
- **Past tense**: Your study findings ("We found that...", "The results showed...")
- **Present tense**: Established facts and your interpretations ("This suggests that...", "These findings indicate...")
- **Future tense**: Implications and future research ("Future studies should investigate...")

### Discussion Strategies

**Comparing to Prior Work:**
```
"Our finding of a 30% reduction in symptoms aligns with Smith et al. (2023), who
reported a 28% reduction using a similar intervention. However, Jones et al. (2022)
found no significant effect, possibly due to their use of a less intensive protocol."
```

**Proposing Mechanisms:**
```
"The observed improvement in cognitive function may result from increased cerebral
blood flow, as evidenced by the concurrent increase in functional MRI signals in the
prefrontal cortex. This interpretation is consistent with the vascular hypothesis of
cognitive enhancement."
```

**Acknowledging Limitations:**
```
"The cross-sectional design prevents causal inference. Additionally, the convenience
sample from a single academic medical center may limit generalizability to community
settings. Self-reported measures may introduce recall bias, though we attempted to
minimize this through structured interviews."
```

### Common Mistakes
- Simply repeating results without interpretation
- Over-interpreting findings or claiming causation without warrant
- Ignoring inconsistent or negative findings
- Failing to compare with existing literature
- Introducing new data or methods
- Generic or superficial discussion of limitations
- Overgeneralization beyond the study population
- Missing the "so what?"—failing to explain significance

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What do these findings mean?
2. How do they compare to prior research?
3. Why might differences exist?
4. What are alternative explanations?
5. What are the limitations?
6. What are the practical implications?
7. What should future research investigate?

## Conclusion

### Purpose
Provide a concise summary of key findings and their significance.

### Placement
- May be a separate section or the final paragraph of Discussion (check journal requirements)

### Content
- 1-2 paragraphs maximum
- Restate the main finding(s)
- Emphasize the significance or implications
- End with a strong, memorable statement
- Do NOT introduce new information

### Example
```
This randomized trial demonstrates that a 12-week mindfulness intervention significantly
reduces anxiety symptoms in college students, with effects persisting at 6-month follow-up.
These findings support the integration of mindfulness-based programs into university mental
health services. Given the scalability and cost-effectiveness of group-based mindfulness
training, this approach offers a promising strategy to address the growing mental health
crisis in higher education.
