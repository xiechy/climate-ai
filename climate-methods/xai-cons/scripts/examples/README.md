## üìä By Application Domain

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature Extremes
#### 1. Neural Network Attribution of Heatwaves
- **Paper:** Barnes et al. (2020), "Viewing Forced Climate Patterns Through an AI Lens"
- **Journal:** Geophysical Research Letters
- **PDF:** `papers/barnes_2020_cam_climate.pdf`
- **XAI Method:** Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
- **Climate Problem:** Forced response pattern identification
- **Key Innovation:** Automated detection of climate change "fingerprints"

**Methodology Highlights:**
- Trained CNN on climate model output (forced + control)
- Used CAM to visualize regions driving classification
- Validated against known physics (Arctic amplification pattern)
- Tested on multiple models for robustness

**Takeaways for Your Research:**
1. CAM works well for spatial pattern detection in gridded climate data
2. Always validate XAI patterns against established physical understanding
3. Test on held-out models to ensure generalization
4. Compare forced pattern to internal variability

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Clouds and Radiation
#### 2. SHAP Analysis of Cloud Feedbacks
- **Paper:** Toms et al. (2020), "Physically Interpretable Neural Networks..."
- **Journal:** Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems
- **PDF:** `papers/toms_2020_neural_net_clouds.pdf`
- **XAI Method:** SHAP + Physical constraints
- **Climate Problem:** Cloud parameterization

**Methodology Highlights:**
- Embedded physical constraints in NN architecture
- Used SHAP to quantify variable importance
- Compared SHAP values to sensitivity tests from traditional model

**Takeaways:**
1. SHAP values align well with traditional sensitivity analysis
2. Embedding physics reduces need for post-hoc XAI
3. Always compare XAI to benchmark methods
