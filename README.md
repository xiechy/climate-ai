## 🎯 Getting Started

### Claude Code
Register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills
```

Then, to install a specific set of skills:

1. Select **Browse and install plugins**
2. Select **claude-scientific-skills**
3. Choose from:
   - `scientific-databases` - Access to 25 scientific databases
   - `scientific-packages` - 51 specialized Python packages
   - `scientific-thinking` - Analysis tools and document processing
   - `scientific-integrations` - Lab automation and platform integrations
   - `scientific-context-initialization` - Ensures Claude searches for and uses existing skills
4. Select **Install now**

After installation, simply mention the skill or describe your task - Claude Code will automatically use the appropriate skills!

> 💡 **Tip**: If you find that Claude isn't utilizing the installed skills as much as you'd like, install the `scientific-context-initialization` skill. It automatically creates/updates an `AGENT.md` file in your workspace that instructs Claude to always search for and use existing skills before attempting any scientific task. This ensures Claude leverages documented patterns, authentication methods, working examples, and best practices from the repository.

### Any MCP Client (including ChatGPT, Cursor, Google ADK, OpenAI Agent SDK, etc.)
Use our newly released MCP server that allows you to use any Claude Skill in any client!

🔗 **[claude-skills-mcp](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-skills-mcp)**

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended for best compatibility)
- **Claude Code**: Latest version or any MCP-compatible client
- **System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Dependencies**: Automatically handled by individual skills (check `SKILL.md` files for specific requirements)

## 💡 Quick Examples

Once you've installed the skills, you can ask Claude to execute complex multi-step scientific workflows:

### End-to-End Drug Discovery Pipeline
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

I need to find novel EGFR inhibitors for lung cancer treatment. Query ChEMBL for existing 
EGFR inhibitors with IC50 < 50nM, analyze their structure-activity relationships using RDKit, 
generate similar molecules with improved properties using datamol, perform virtual screening 
with DiffDock against the AlphaFold-predicted EGFR structure, and search PubMed for recent 
papers on resistance mechanisms to prioritize scaffolds. Finally, check COSMIC for common 
EGFR mutations and assess how our candidates might interact with mutant forms. 
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
```

### Comprehensive Single-Cell Analysis Workflow
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

Load this 10X Genomics dataset using Scanpy, perform quality control and doublet removal, 
integrate with public data from Cellxgene Census for the same tissue type, identify cell 
populations using known markers from NCBI Gene, perform differential expression analysis 
with PyDESeq2, run gene regulatory network inference with Arboreto, query Reactome and 
KEGG for pathway enrichment, and create publication-quality visualizations with matplotlib. 
Then cross-reference top dysregulated genes with Open Targets to identify potential 
therapeutic targets.
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
```

### Multi-Omics Integration for Biomarker Discovery
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

I have RNA-seq, proteomics, and metabolomics data from cancer patients. Use PyDESeq2 for 
differential expression, pyOpenMS to analyze mass spec data, and integrate metabolite 
information from HMDB and Metabolomics Workbench. Map proteins to pathways using UniProt 
and KEGG, identify protein-protein interactions via STRING, correlate multi-omics layers 
using statsmodels, and build a machine learning model with scikit-learn to predict patient 
outcomes. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials targeting the top candidates.
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
```

### Structure-Based Virtual Screening Campaign
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

I want to discover allosteric modulators for a protein-protein interaction. Retrieve the 
AlphaFold structure for both proteins, identify the interaction interface using BioPython, 
search ZINC15 for molecules with suitable properties for allosteric binding (MW 300-500, 
logP 2-4), filter for drug-likeness using RDKit, perform molecular docking with DiffDock 
to identify potential allosteric sites, rank candidates using DeepChem's property prediction 
models, check PubChem for suppliers, and search USPTO patents to assess freedom to operate. 
Finally, generate analogs with MedChem and molfeat for lead optimization.
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
```

### Clinical Genomics Variant Interpretation Pipeline
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

Analyze this VCF file from a patient with suspected hereditary cancer. Use pysam to parse 
variants, annotate with Ensembl for functional consequences, query ClinVar for known 
pathogenic variants, check COSMIC for somatic mutations in cancer, retrieve gene information 
from NCBI Gene, analyze protein impact using UniProt, search PubMed for case reports of 
similar variants, query ClinPGx for pharmacogenomic implications, and generate a clinical 
report with ReportLab. Then search ClinicalTrials.gov for precision medicine trials matching 
the patient's profile.
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
```

### Systems Biology Network Analysis
```
"Always use available 'skills' when possible. Keep the output organized.

Starting with a list of differentially expressed genes from my RNA-seq experiment, query 
NCBI Gene for detailed annotations, retrieve protein sequences from UniProt, identify 
protein-protein interactions using STRING, map to biological pathways in Reactome and KEGG, 
analyze network topology with Torch Geometric, identify hub genes and bottleneck proteins, 
perform gene regulatory network reconstruction with Arboreto, integrate with Open Targets 
for druggability assessment, use PyMC for Bayesian network modeling, and create interactive 
network visualizations. Finally, search GEO for similar expression patterns across diseases.
Create useful visualizations in the form of scientific figures as you go (if needed).
When done, create a comprehensive README.md and a well formatted pdf summarizing the methodology, 
results, conclusions and providing recommendations."
